   The church was established to raise earthly relevant people and heavenly bound generation,
We believe in missions based upon Mathew 28:19-20. Every Christian, in every legitimate way, all the time, 
everywhere, according to ability, ought to seek to spread knowledge of Jesus and the way of salvation.
No one can be a true believer who has not repented of sin, trusted Jesus, and him alone, for life and salvation,
 and seeks to know and do the will of His divine Lord. </p>

(Eph 4:12) Leadership by education and training because “Integration without preparation equals frustration”.
2.	 “Set at Liberty them that are bound by Sins and Satan”. (Isaiah 61:1 & Luke 4:18)
3.	Liberation that secures jobs, housing, education, human rights and the breaking of all satanic fetters”.
