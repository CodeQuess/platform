                                The Church started with this God’s audible and specific instruction ‘GO TO GWARINPA’.
                                 This instruction was given to His servant Revd. Dr. Olurotimi Owolabi some years ago 
                                 after he finished his M.Div from the Baptist Theological Seminary, Ogbomosho. 
                                 Just like Paul said before King Agrippa ‘I cannot but obey the heavenly vision’. 
                                 This simple obedience led to the establishment of Baptist Church in Gwarinpa Estate in Abuja.
                                 Gwarinpa Estate is unique being one of the single largest Estates in Africa
                                 but without Baptist Place of Worship prior to that time.
                                 The church was established on April 6, 2008
                                 and since then the presence of Yahweh has been very visible.
                                 It is indeed the atmosphere of God’s grace.
                                .
